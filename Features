DESCRIPTION
A simple gui program for interpolating a profile plot into rings, as commonly seen in electron diffraction in the TEM. Like an "inverse rotational average". Intended for education.



FEATURES
- Import and show profile plots from text files with different formatting (rows, columns, csv files etc.)
	* Figure out common formats
- Generate diffraction ring plot from profile
	* Allow user to control both data and plotting range
- Export image of rings
	* Optional scalebar
	

EXTRA FEATURES
- Calibration option
- Brightness/contrast controls
- Colormap selection (reversed)
- Simulate various artifacts
	* Background
	* Beam stopper
	* Focus
	* Noise
- Batch convert a folder of files
- Import from excel files
